Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/mkusy,Himachal Pradesh,,"The scheme ""Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana"" was launched by the Department of Agriculture, Government of Himachal Pradesh by merging three ongoing protection based Departmental schemes namely Sour Badhbandi, Anti-Hail Net Structure & Green House Renovation Scheme into a single scheme having a common objective.The three components of the scheme are as under:1.	Sour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing): Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme ""Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana"" in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.2.	Anti-Hail Net Structure: Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme ""Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)"" was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme ""Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna"" in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.3.	Green House Renovation Scheme: Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme ""Mukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme"" in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme ""Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana"" as a component namely Green House Renovation. Under this scheme, 70% assistance is being provided to the farmers for the replacement of poly sheets after 5 years of setting up of polyhouse or damage due to natural calamities.","1.

In border areas, the provision of essential infrastructure facilities and opportunities for sustainable living would help integrate these areas with the hinterland, create a positive perception of care by the country and encourage people to stay on in the border areas, leading to safe and secure borders.The following basic principles will guide the implementation of the BADP: a) Projects for developing infrastructure in strategically important villages/towns (as identified by Border Guarding Forces) will be given priority. b) Border Guarding Forces (BGFs) will be co-opted as part of the decision making process at all levels (Planning/ Execution / Monitoring). c) Keeping in view the limited availability of funds under BADS, the State/UT Level Screening Committee (SLSC/UTLSC) will ensure convergence with schemes of line Ministries and State/UT Governments and other available resources to ensure holistic development of the strategically important villages/ towns in the border areas. d) MHA will work in close collaboration with, inter-alia, M/o Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, M/o DoNER, M/o Health & Family Welfare, M/o Human Resource Development, M/o Jai Shakti, M/o New and Renewable Energy, M/o Power, M/o Rural Development, M/o Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, M/o MSME, M/o Women & Child Development, M/o Youth Affairs & Sports etc. to promote infrastructure development, improved connectivity, better social services and to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities in the border areas. e) Works/projects will be evaluated regularly through Social Audit mechanism, besides Prabhari Officers in addition to ongoing mechanisms of State/UT/ Central Governments. f) Saturation / coverage through ongoing developmental schemes of various Ministries of Government of India, if necessary, by relaxation of guidelines and yardsticks with the approval of the competent authority. g) Medium-Term perspective -- Four/Five Year Perspective Action Plan would be prepared for development of identified habitations by pooling resources as mentioned in sub clause (c) above. For the subsequent years, the Annual Plan would be drawn up within the overall perspective plan and inclusive of objectives carried forward, modifications necessitated due to lessons learnt and other developments. The Annual Plans would be a subset of the same. For the first year, along with a prospective plan, an annual plan would also be submitted. The States would strive to achieve saturation of beneficiaries and creation of infrastructure under various Government Schemes by 2023. h) Competition among Districts: The Districts would be challenged to compete among themselves on the basis of incremental changes and their performance would be recognized and rewarded. i) Comprehensive Development: For comprehensive development of border districts, BADP will have two components - first will be saturation of beneficiaries and ensuring creation of infrastructure in border districts through convergence of various Government Schemes, and second part will be Border Area Development Scheme(BADS) for convergence and filling up gaps to achieve desired levels of development.","(A) Roads and Bridges   (i) Construction and up-gradation of roads.

Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir (UT), Ladakh (UT), Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Previously it has largely worked as a 'stand-alone' vehicle for project financing; it will now be converted to a programme which seeks comprehensive development. The program will cover all the census villages/ towns, semi-urban and urban areas located within 0-10 Km distance (crow -- fly/ aerial distance) from the first habitation from International Boundary (IB). The imaginary line joining all the first habitations from the IB will be the Zero line for BADP and the 10 km distance towards the interior will be calculated from this zero line. The State/UT Government will compile and provide a latest map of this border belt (0-10 Km) - district wise, depicting all the census villages, semi-urban/ urban areas with latest population statistics. The State/UT Government will furnish village/ town code (2011 Census) allotted by Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, Government of India, for mapping of the villages/ towns on the BADP Online Management System (BADP OMS).Within this 0-10 km area, census villages, semi-urban and urban areas identified by BGFs as 'strategic villages/towns' shall be given highest priority.
