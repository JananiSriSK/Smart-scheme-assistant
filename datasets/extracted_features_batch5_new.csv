Transgender share the same hopes and dreams as any other individual in our society. 58% of Transgender students drop out before completing 10th grade (24% of Transgender students drop out even before completion of 9th grade). Reasons for this include- severe harassment making studies impossible and other gender-related negative experiences at school. In order to help such school dropouts continue their education, Social Justice Department has implemented a scholarship scheme for Transgender.           The transgender community is still ostracized in society and cannot take up job offers or continue their education due to a lack of accommodation facilities. Though there has been improvement in the mindset of the people, still the stigma of giving transgender persons a house exists in society.

Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yozana - Assam,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/mmkssy-assam,Assam,,"Agriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state's population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme ""Mukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana"" (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19. The scheme ""Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana"" is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of ""Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana"" the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed:1.	Rs 5000/- will be provided to each farmer2.	The number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers.3.	The assistance is to procure farm tools/farm implements.4.

The Principal Secretaries will chair the DLC in the case of BTAD and Autonomous Districts.6.	The Scheme will be implemented under the overall supervision of the State-Level Monitoring Committee chaired by the Agriculture Production Commissioner.",Through this scheme farm mechanization for the cultivation of different crops will be promoted in order to increase the production and productivity of different crops.With the implementation of this scheme income of farmers will increase. Other than that this scheme will also save the labour and time of the farmers.Through this scheme financial assistance of Rs 5000 will be provided to every farmer to procure farm tools and the assistance will be provided through Direct Benefit Transfer.This scheme promotes scientific cultivation practices by encouraging farmers in procuring scientific farm tools. This scheme helps in the transfer of technology to the farmer's field.,The beneficiary should be a resident farmer of Assam.Only small and marginal farmers are eligible for the benefit under the scheme.The beneficiary should be more than 21 years old.He or she should be involved in cultivation for at least three consecutive years.All Kisan Credit Card (KCC) holders are eligible to apply under the scheme.The applicant Beneficiary should have a live bank account.Only one farmer per family shall be eligible for the benefit under the scheme.Tenant farmers or sharecroppers with a minimum cultivation area of 1 Acre / 3 Bighas may also be considered under the scheme.,"OfflineApplication in Assamese: https://diragri.assam.gov.in/sites/default/files/swf_utility_folder/departments/diragri_medhassu_in_oid_4/menu/schemes/Application%20in%20Assamese.pdfApplication in English: https://diragri.assam.gov.in/sites/default/files/swf_utility_folder/departments/diragri_medhassu_in_oid_4/menu/schemes/Application%20in%20English.pdfStep 01: Agriculture Department will publish the advertisement through the print and electronic media in order to invite applications from the respective websiteStep 02: This application will be collected by the Agriculture Extension Assistant (AEA) along with bank account details of beneficiaries with their mobile numbersStep 03: The beneficiary will be selected GP/VDP wise.Step 04: Gaon Panchayats are required to make a list of all the beneficiaries and compile it by the Agriculture Development Officer (ADO) concerned and this list will be placed before the District-level Committee(DLC) after the scrutiny.Step 05: A list of farmers from AEAs/ADOs will be approved by District Level Committee.Step 06: SC and ST farmers will be selected as per the state reservation act which is 7% for SC, 10% for ST (P), and 5% for ST (H).Step 07: After the approval of the beneficiary list, the list will be sent to the Director of agriculture with the bank account details and mobile number details.

Price Support Scheme,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pss,Assam,,"The Price Support Scheme (PSS) is being implemented by the Government of India in the state. Main crops of the state like Bajra, Jowar, Maize, Paddy, Cotton, Tur, Moong, Urad, Groundnut, Sesamum Wheat, Gram, Mustard, and Sugarcane etc. are covered.The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation implements the PSS for procurement of oil seeds, pulses and cotton, through NAFED which is the Central nodal agency, at the MSP declared by the government.NAFED undertakes procurement as and when prices fall below the MSP. Procurement under PSS is continued till prices stabilize at or above the MSP.Assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers/farmers is very important for increasing agricultural production and productivity. The market price for agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volatile which may result into undue losses to the growers and discourage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs. The Government's price policy for agricultural commodities strives to ensure profitable prices to the growers with a vision of encouraging higher investment and production. This leads to safeguarding the consumer interest by making available supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation. Moreover, the price policy aims at changing a balance and integrated price structure with respect to the overall needs of the economy. Let us take a look at the Price Support Scheme, an initiative taken by the Government to ensure a productive environment for farmers.","1)	When prices of commodities fall below the MSP, State and central notified procurement nodal agencies purchase commodities directly from the farmers at MSP, Under specified FAQ ( fair Average Quality).2)	In this way prices of the main commodities are procured and protect the farmers against the economic loss in farming.3)	Price supports cause larger production and smaller consumption (since consumers will buy less of any good as its price rises), resulting in overproduction at the support price.",1)	Farmers get the benefit of the scheme by selling their produce at support price in APMC centers opened by the Nodal procurement agency. 2)	Farmers belong to Assam State. 3)	Government employees are not allowed to apply to the scheme.,"OfflineDownload the application form for the Price Support Scheme official website.

SERB-Technology Translation Award,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/serb-tetra,All India,Ministry Of Science And Technology,"The ""SERB-Technology Translation Award (SERB-TETRA)"" is a new scheme launched by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India for catalyzing technology translation in academic settings. Translation research has gained considerable focus as it has the potential to elevate results from fundamental research to a given technology readiness level, in turn catalyzing symbiotic growth of institutional infrastructure to offer a platform for scale-up of entrepreneurial ventures, supported by a variety of funding mechanisms. SERB-TETRA will challenge scientists executing SERB grants, such as CRG, to establish an effective, functional, and synergistic working collaboration with an industry partner to elevate their breakthrough results and technologies to TRL level 5 and beyond. It is implicit that PIs would have obtained the necessary patents and IPRs.         TETRA Support will help entities have successful ideas to kick-start new venture processes. With seed capital, flexible working spaces, and interaction between mentor and start-up entrepreneurs, the SERB-TETRA will expand the scope by providing numerous networking opportunities, followed by presenting the finished prototype to an audience of large investors, established MSMEs and private companies, and public sector enterprises.        SERB-TETRA would be awarded to select PIs who have clearly demonstrated the translational potential of their research (patents, etc.) and have established contact with industrial partners for fast-track graduation to a prototype stage and beyond. PIs would have also identified technology incubators in their own institution or in the vicinity who could support their endeavors. It is envisaged that a well-defined strategy to augment research innovation, via technology incubators, will add value to the CRG and other funding mechanisms supported by SERB.Objective:SERB-TETRA aims to provide awards to competitively funded Core Research Grants (CRG) and similar projects, holding potential and promise for translation at TRL 5 or beyond. Scientific Social Responsibility:SERB has adopted the Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy to imbibe a culture of social commitment among SERB Grantees. The policy intends to effectively utilize the scientific infrastructure and expertise of SERB grantees to benefit other S&T stakeholders, especially the less-endowed researchers and society.

The Hon'ble Prime Minister launched the scheme in Daman on 25th February 2018 and Hon'ble Home Minister in Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 20th April 2018. Under this scheme, a take-home ration (7.5kgs nutritious) is provided every month to Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers, and Sabla (Adolescent Category girls in the age group of 11-14 years).        The nutritional status of women and children in the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is alarming. The UT Administration decided to wage war against undernutrition and came up with the ""Swabhimaan Scheme"" as one of the potent tools. The scheme builds on the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) being implemented by the government of India. One of the components of ICDS is the provision of supplementary nutrition to children, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. However, this nutrition was being provided as a cooked meal and the beneficiary had to visit the Anganwadi daily to avail of this benefit. Loss of wages or working time coupled with poor condition of Anganwadis, and poor attendance of Anganwadi workers led to low enrollment and poor uptake of supplementary nutrition.Objectives:Improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girlsProvide a monthly quota of supplementary nutrition to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls on a fixed day of every month as a take-home ration.Increase the number of beneficiaries availing of the scheme. Increase attendance of women in the Anganwadis where they can also avail of benefits of other schemes and be made aware of health and hygiene issues.Reduction in stunting, Premature deliveries, and low-weight babies.","Under the scheme, the beneficiaries are provided a monthly quota of supplementary nutrition to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls on a fixed day of every month as a take-home ration.The items provided in the supplementary nutrition kits are procured from the market through an open and transparent process.

Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnscr,All India,Ministry Of Culture,"The Scheme ""Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research"" has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging scholars/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.    With a view to infusing fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these scholars/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Scholars to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:1.	Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries2.	Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Scholarship3.	Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology4.	Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary ArtsScope of the Scheme:The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Scholars of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the 'Nodal Institution' for each project, and the Scholars will be attached/anchored to that institution.Duration of the Scholarship:The duration of the Tagore Scholarship is up to 2 years.In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the Scholar won't be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.The award of the Scholarship will commence from the date of joining and the 'months' and 'years' will be reckoned accordingly.Number of Scholarships:The scheme envisages the granting of up to 25 Scholarships in a year.Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Scholarship or a maximum of 2 scholarships in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.Administration of the Scheme:The total number of Scholarships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Scholars to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Scholars, through outsourcing or Consultants.

The research work may also include the identification and cataloging of sources available with the institution or the archiving and creation of new sources that the institution should have. (Guidelines for preparing research proposal are given in Appendix A)Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:The selected Scholars will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Scholar otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship would recommend the Scholars to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Scholars, the second institution may be deemed to be the 'Co-institution' and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.","OfflineApplication Process:Step 01: The Ministry of Culture and/or the concerned institution will widely advertise the Scholarship in the leading national/regional newspapers and on its website (which should give all details) and also disseminate the scheme through professional associations/forums in the relevant fields, so that maximum publicity is accorded to the Scheme.Step 02: Eligible Scholars who can spare time of about two years to do a project based on the resources of any of the participating institutions can only apply during the prescribed timeline mentioned in the advertisement.Step 03: The candidates may submit their application form, prepared according to the prescribed guidelines of the Scheme, to any one of the Nodal Institutions of his/her choice depending upon the area of research proposed to be undertaken.Step 04: Candidates may submit their application form along with a biocatalyst of publications and other relevant documents including a write-up on the proposed work (guidelines are in Appendix A), the applicant should enclose a declaration stating that if selected for the Scholarship, he/she will complete the tenure of the Scholarship.Note: The list of nodal institutions along with the other relevant details of the Scheme and application form is available on the website of the Ministry of Culture and Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML) (erstwhile Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) under the Scheme Head of the website.Process of Selection:Step 01: The received applications will be examined by the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) constituted by each participating institution for the purposes of this scheme.Step 02: The applications found worthy of consideration will be shortlisted by the ILSSC.Step 03: The selection will be based on the relevance of the study, the benefits of the nodal institution from that particular study, and the credentials and reputation of the scholar. Only such proposals may be selectedthat seek to (a) engage Scholars who have achieved national or international recognition and proven acceptance of their work in national/ international circles; (b) bring out resources that are not yet fully out in the public domain; and (c) publish the work for the benefit of the concerned institution. The selection will be done in two stages.Step 04: The first stage will be of shortlisting of projects and candidates by the ILSSC, according to the criteria broadly specified as part of the Search-cum-Screening process. Apart from considering the applications received, the ILSSC is also expected to adopt a proactive approach to identify relevant projects and search for reputed Scholars in that field, contact such Scholars, and encourage them to submit their proposals. If the received proposals are not worthy of consideration, the ILSSC need not feel compelled to recommend any proposals for consideration by the NSC.Step 05: At the second stage, applications/names of short-listed candidates will be considered by the NSC for each institution.Contact Details:(i)	Director, Nehru Memorial Museum & Library, Teen Murti Bhawan, New Delhi-1100011.@ Ph.

Kanyashree Prakalpa,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/wbkanyashree,West Bengal,,"Kanyashree Prakalpa seeks to improve the status and well-being of girls, specifically those from socio-economically disadvantaged families through Conditional Cash Transfers by:Incentivizing them to continue in education for a longer period, and complete secondary or higher secondary education, or equivalent in technical or vocational steams, thereby giving them a better footing in both the economic and social spheres.Disincentivizing marriage till at least the age of 18, the legal age of marriage, thereby reducing the risks of early pregnancies, associated risks of maternal and child mortality, and other debilitating health conditions, including that malnutrition.It was also decided that the Scheme should confer more than just monetary support; it should be a means of financial inclusion and a tool of empowerment for adolescent girls. The scheme's benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls' names, leaving the decision of utilizing the money in their hands.To reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behavior change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions, and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment.As more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to help them become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social and emotional development will give them a better foundation for their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it is expected that the practice of child marriage will be completely eradicated. Women will attain their right to health, education, and socio-economic equality.The main objective of the scheme is to prevent child marriage and promote education among girls. It also aims to improve the health and nutrition of girls and empower them by building their skills and capacities.The scheme is implemented through a network of school teachers, community workers, and government officials.
