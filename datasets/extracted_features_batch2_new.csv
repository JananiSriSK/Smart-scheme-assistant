Snehasparsham,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/s-kerala,Kerala,,"The Government of Kerala has launched the ""Snehasparsham"" scheme to protect and help unwed mothers. The problems of unwed mothers are linked with various socio-economic and cultural variables. In Kerala, this problem is coupled with the ignorance and exploitation of the backward classes. It has been pointed out that there are many women in Wayanad and other districts of Kerala who are victims of social exploitation and atrocities and are often forced to become unmarried mothers. Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers.             As a part of this scheme, the Government is giving Rs1000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back. Their place is taken up by someone else whom these women believe in. Therefore, their condition becomes pathetic and it becomes necessary to address their problems too.","Under the scheme, financial assistance of Rs1000/- per month will be given to unwed mothers.",The applicant should be a resident of Kerala State.The applicant should be an unwed mother.The applicant should be under 65 years.The applicant should not be a recipient of any other pension schemes of the government.

The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.            The statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family's main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused & exploited.            Children in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.Objectives of the Scheme:To identify the orphaned children in the community.To assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.To provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.To improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.To encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.To extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.",Sl.
