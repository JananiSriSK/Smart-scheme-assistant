Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmay-g,All India,Ministry Of Rural Development,"Launch on 1st April 2016, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana Gramin (PMAY-G) is centre's flagship mission by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). PMAY-G aims at providing a pucca house, with basic amenities, to all houseless households and those households living in kutcha and dilapidated house. PMAY-G addresses the rural housing shortage and bridges the housing deficit in rural areas of India, contributing significantly to the mission of ""Housing for All"". The minimum size of the houses under PMAY-G is 25 sq m including a dedicated area for hygienic cooking. As of 27th Sept 2022, 2.00 crore houses have been constructed out of the total target of 2.72 crores. The beneficiaries are identified using the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) parameters and verified by the Gram Sabhas. The amount is transferred directly to the Aadhaar-Linked Bank Account / Post-Office Account of the beneficiary. PMAY-G has been extended for another two years, i.e. till 31st March 2024.Aim and Objective:PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2024. The immediate objective is to cover 1.00 Crore households in rural areas, that are houseless or living in kutcha / dilapidated house, in three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 and enable construction of quality houses by the beneficiaries using local materials, designs and trained masons. For houses to become homes, adoption of a habitat approach through convergence is proposed.","Financial Assistance of Rs 1,20,000 per unit for plain areas; and Rs 1,30,000 per unit for hilly areas, difficult areas, and IAP districts (Himalayan states, North-Eastern states, and Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir).A willing beneficiary can avail of institutional finance (loan) of up to Rs 70,000 at 3% lower interest rate, to build a permanent house. The maximum principal amount for which subsidy can be sought is Rs 2,00,000.The minimum size of the house shall be is 25 sq m including a dedicated area for hygienic cooking.In convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G), the beneficiaries get financial assistance of up to Rs 12,000 for the construction of toilets.In convergence with MGNREGA, the beneficiary is entitled to employment as unskilled labor (Rural Mason Training) at Rs 90.95 per day for 95 days.In convergence with Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, one LPG connection per house is provided.Convergence with different government programmes for piped drinking water, electricity connection, clean & efficient cooking fuel, treatment of social and liquid waste, etc.Payments are made electronically directly to bank accounts or post office accounts that are linked to Aadhaar.Note: Beneficiaries are identified using the ""Housing Deprivation Parameters"" from the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 [https://secc.gov.in/], further verified by the Gram Sabhas.","The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).Criteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion - 1.	Households without shelter2.	Destitute/ living on alms3.	Manual scavengers4.	Primitive Tribal Groups5.	Legally released bonded laborerPrioritisation within the Universei.  There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. ii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. iii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.Within the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of ""compulsory inclusion"", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. The scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:i.	Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59ii.	Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59iii.	Households with no literate adult above 25 yearsiv.	Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult memberv.	Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual laborvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.Note: To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.Earmarking of Targets - For SC/ST:60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.For Minorities:Further, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.For PwDs:Accordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.Tie BreakerIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:i.	Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.ii.	Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).iii.	Households with a single girl child.iv.

Chief Minister Floriculture Mission,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/cmfm,Assam,,"Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.It is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State's flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State's flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State's revenue in substantial quantum.It is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.","Govt. will provide planting materials, required quantity of shade net and one garden tool kit as Govt. share.The beneficiaries will have to erect the bamboo/steel structure themselves under observation of departmental officers as beneficiary's share.The cost of bed preparation, fertilizer etc. will have to be borne by the beneficiaries.Departmental officers will provide complete technical support to the beneficiaries.For the year 2015- 16 cultivation of Gerbera under Shade net house with tissue cultured planting materials is proposed to be taken up covering an area of 200 sqm. per unit area.",The component will be implemented in rural and urban areas.The beneficiaries should be of small and marginal category.Women SHGs and unemployed youths should get preference.The beneficiaries should have their own land in their premises or rented land on long term lease.Modern cultivation technology will disseminated by the concerning departmental officers through training and skill teaching.One beneficiary can avail only one unit e>200 sqm.Proper representation from SC and ST farmers should be ensured.Beneficiary selection will be finalized by the District Level Beneficiaries Selection Committee through wide publicity in mass media.The District Level Beneficiaries Selection Committee will monitor the program time to time and DAO/DNO will report the progress of work to HQ every fortnight.,"OfflinePlease contact to the office of below mentioned for apply the scheme.The Secretary to the Govt. of Assam Agriculture Department, Dispur, Guwahati-6.Director of Horticulture and FP Assam, Khanapara, Guwahati-22.",Aadhaar Card.Voter card.A Valid Bank Account.Cultivation of TC Gerbera in Agro shade net house Unit area:200 sqm.,"Chief Minister Floriculture Mission, cmfm, Cultivation, Farmer, Marketing, Trainning, myScheme, Government Schemes, Government Scheme, GovernmentScheme, GovernmentSchemes, Find Government Scheme, Gov Scheme Platform, Gov Scheme",,,True,,,,True,,,True,True,,,,,,,,,,,True,True,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The banks may fix the quantum of credit for the term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank's judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.The long-term loan limit is based on the proposed investments during the five-year period and the bank's perception of the repaying capacity of the farmer Maximum Permissible Limit: The short-term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long-term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and treated as the Kisan Credit Card Limit.Fixation of Sub-limits for other than Marginal Farmers: Short-term loans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. Besides, at present, short-term crop loans are covered under Interest Subvention Scheme/ Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme. Further, repayment schedules and norms are different for short-term and term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting convenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub-limits for short-term cash credit limit cum savings account and term loans. The drawing limit for short-term cash credit should be fixed based on the cropping pattern and the amounts for crop production, repairs and maintenance of farm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn at the convenience of the farmer. In case the revision of the scale of finance for any year by the district-level committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five-year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed and the farmer is advised about the same. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. For term loans, instalments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of the investment and the repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point in time, the total liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year. Wherever the card limit/liability so arrived warrants additional security, the banks may take suitable collateral as per their policy.","EligibilityFarmers - individual/joint borrowers who are owner cultivators;Tenant farmers, oral lessees & share croppers;Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of farmers including tenant farmers, share croppers etc","OnlineOfflineVisit the website of the bank you wish to apply for the kisan credit card scheme.

Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research,https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/tnfcr,All India,Ministry Of Culture,"The Scheme ""Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research"" has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging Fellows/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.    With a view to infuse fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these Fellows/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:1.	Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries2.	Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Fellowship3.	Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology4.	Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary ArtsScope of the Scheme:The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Fellows of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the 'Nodal Institution' for each project, and the Fellows will be attached/anchored to that institution.Duration of the Fellowship:The duration of the Fellowship will be for a maximum period of two years.In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the fellow won't be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.The award of the Fellowship will commence from the date of joining and the 'months' and 'years' will be reckoned accordingly.Number of Fellowships:The scheme envisages the granting of up to 15 Fellowships in a year.Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Fellowship in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.Administration of the Scheme:The total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants. ","Honorarium:A Tagore National Fellow who is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government setup in India would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization. Essential or mandatory contributions of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations as would have been paid by them had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.A Fellow from abroad or from a set-up other than University, College, Research Institute or Government service, or who has retired from active service and/or is on pension, would be entitled to a fixed honorarium of Rs80,000/- per month.No payment of honorarium would normally be made to a Fellow receiving full funding from other sources up to the level of the honorarium, but such Fellow will, however, receive a Contingency Grant, other allowances, and facilities, as decided by the NSC.  Contingency Grant:In case of foreign and Indian research fellows residing or serving abroad and having been selected as Tagore Fellows under Non-MoC institutions, to and fro economy class airfare from their country of residence will be provided/reimbursed by the Ministry once during the course of the Fellowship.Similarly, all fellows under Non-MoC institutions who take up the Fellowship under the Scheme will be reimbursed, on an 'actual' basis, contingent expenses for making academic trips, engaging research assistants, etc. up to a maximum ceiling of Rs2.50 lakhs per annum, during the tenure of Fellowship subject to verification of requisite bills by the Nodal Institutions.Note: For Fellows selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.Accommodation:A Fellow who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Fellowship.The selected Fellow will be entitled to receive a House Rent Allowance of up to 30% of the honorarium. However, with respect to Fellows from Universities, colleges, Research institutes, or Government setups HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.The MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.In respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Fellows on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement.Settling Allowance:A Fellow from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of Rs1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of Fellowship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.Allowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Fellowship for moving out of station. On a case-to-case basis, economy airfare from his/her place/country of residence will be provided/reimbursed upon joining and at the conclusion of the Fellowship. In this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.Support to Fellows:Infrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Fellows to enable them to conduct their research. This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution's premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.One important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Fellows to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign fellows engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.Encouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Fellows to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an 'actuals' basis, with a ceiling of Rs1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged","Fellows who have sound academic or professional credentials and have made significant contributions to knowledge in their respective fields will be eligible to apply for Tagore National Fellowship.Preferably the Fellows who have 5 years of experience in conducting/guiding research or the same experience in performing/any other arts can apply for Tagore National Fellowship.The applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit, at least two monographs (single-authored).Fellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph, as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the Nodal Institution.Those who have in the past directly engaged with major projects at the Nodal Institution and fulfilled the above-mentioned eligibility criteria for a Tagore Fellow are encouraged to apply for the Tagore National Fellowship.Once awarded a Tagore National Fellowship, a candidate cannot apply again for a Fellowship under this scheme, either at the same or any other institution covered under the Scheme.The Scheme will be open to both Indian and foreign nationals. However, the proportion of foreigners will not normally exceed one-third of the total fellowships awarded in a year.Note 01: Interested Fellows are required to enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in Appendix A.Note 02: Fellows are also required to prepare a short write-up on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.Note 03: The honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order; the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) of the sponsoring institution and the National Selection Committee may keep these in mind while recommending/ selecting the Tagore National Fellows.Note 04: In short, a person selected for the Tagore National Fellowship should be one who has already become a 'legend' in his area of work or is regarded very highly. It is appropriate that those who do not come near this description may not apply or be considered for the highest honour and honorarium accorded to a Fellow in India under this Fellowship.Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:The selected Fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the 'Co-institution' and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.","OfflineApplication Process:Step 01: The Ministry of Culture and/or the concerned institution will widely advertise the Fellowship in the leading national/regional newspapers and on its website (which should give all details) and also disseminate the scheme through professional associations/forums in the relevant fields, so that maximum publicity is accorded to the Scheme.Step 02: The eligible fellows who can spare time of about two years to do a project based on the resources of any of the participating institutions can only apply during the prescribed timeline mentioned in the advertisement.Step 03: The candidates may submit their application form, prepared according to the prescribed guidelines of the Scheme, to any one of the Nodal Institutions of his/her choice depending upon the area of research proposed to be undertaken.Step 04: The candidates may submit their application form along with a biocatalyst of publications and other relevant documents including a write-up on the proposed work (guidelines are in Appendix A), the applicant should enclose a declaration stating that if selected for the Fellowship, he/she will complete the tenure of the Fellowship.Note: The list of nodal institutions along with the other relevant details of the Scheme and application form is available on the website of the Ministry of Culture and Prime Ministers Museum and Library (PMML) (erstwhile Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) under the Scheme Head of the website.Process of Selection:Step 01: The received applications will be examined by the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) constituted by each participating institution for the purposes of this scheme.Step 02: The applications found worthy of consideration will be shortlisted by the ILSSC.Step 03: The selection will be based on the relevance of the study, the benefits of the nodal institution from that particular study, and the credentials and reputation of the scholar. Only such proposals may be selectedthat seek to (a) engage fellows who have achieved national or international recognition and proven acceptance of their work in national/ international circles; (b) bring out resources that are not yet fully out in the public domain; and (c) publish the work for the benefit of the concerned institution. The selection will be done in two stages.Step 04: The first stage will be of shortlisting of projects and candidates by the ILSSC, according to the criteria broadly specified as part of the Search-cum-Screening process. Apart from considering the applications received, the ILSSC is also expected to adopt a proactive approach to identify relevant projects and search for reputed fellows in that field, contact such fellows, and encourage them to submit their proposals. If the received proposals are not worthy of consideration, the ILSSC need not feel compelled to recommend any proposals for consideration by the NSC.Step 05: At the second stage, applications/names of short-listed candidates will be considered by the NSC for each institution.Contact Details:Director, Nehru Memorial Museum & Library, Teen Murti Bhawan, New Delhi-1100011.       @ Ph.
